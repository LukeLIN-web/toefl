一个方法让我测试是否标准：可以对着打开苹果语音输入然后说口语，看哪些单词没被识别到，来自己找发音错误。课程和方法都感觉很有用。 一下子就知道自己说的哪些太轻了, 哪些时态不对.
推荐b站吴奇老师的tpo标准回答，可以学习语音语调观点和节奏。

推的speakingdataset路径是https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s3P9dmhc-kT7lbzJ9PyhzQ   备考资料---------TOEFL120slides

20-24分 :  不要犹豫, 发音清晰, 无卡顿, 不要讲太快,口齿清楚. 

要提供足够的细节,  比如 it has the biggest, oldest department stores that you have ever seen.  可以举例子, 
不能只是 列出一堆理由然后不提供细节. 好看好玩好吃, 为啥好玩为啥好看? 


听力材料前面十秒会介绍背景, 不用记, 没有关系. 最关键的是和阅读材料的对比. 是怎么反驳的, 每个关键词要讲出来.

你的流畅度不足，即句中会有犹豫和卡顿。你在表达时可能存在重复用词、句式单调的情况。你的语法方面会有明显的语法错误，比如三单、单复数、时态、人称性别等等，或者表达不符合英文习惯，表达较为中式。

细节要讲出来. who, when, where, what, how

重读, 合理的重音. 

生物和心理的话题常考, 可以把听力的这些话题都跟读一下. 不用每个词都一样, 主干意思能说出来就行,不然花太多时间了. 

要会用连词连接, 表达因果.
