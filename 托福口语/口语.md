一个方法让我测试是否标准：可以对着打开苹果语音输入然后说口语，看哪些单词没被识别到，来自己找发音错误。课程和方法都感觉很有用。 一下子就知道自己说的哪些太轻了, 哪些时态不对.
推荐b站吴奇老师的tpo标准回答，可以学习语音语调观点和节奏。

20-24分 :  不要犹豫, 发音清晰, 无卡顿, 不要讲太快,口齿清楚. 

要提供足够的细节,  比如 it has the biggest, oldest department stores that you have ever seen.  可以举例子, 
不能只是 列出一堆理由然后不提供细节. 好看好玩好吃, 为啥好玩为啥好看? 


听力材料前面十秒会介绍背景, 不用记, 没有关系. 最关键的是和阅读材料的对比. 是怎么反驳的, 每个关键词要讲出来.

你的流畅度不足，即句中会有犹豫和卡顿。你在表达时可能存在重复用词、句式单调的情况。你的语法方面会有明显的语法错误，比如三单、单复数、时态、人称性别等等，或者表达不符合英文习惯，表达较为中式。

细节要讲出来. who, when, where, what, how

重读, 合理的重音.

开头: I strongly agree with the opinion that 

音乐:

It tells us a story about confidence and courage. I listen to this song whenever I am down, and it will immediately cheer me up. What’s more, I love this kind of music style. I prefer some songs with slow and emotional rhythms because when I am listening, I can think and appreciate the song's real meaning. Personally, I can’t bear those rock and roll songs. Therefore I will recommend this song to everyone.

金钱

Money helps us buy clothes and delicious food. It also allows our families to pay for home supplies. Sometimes we don't have enough money for what we want or need. Maybe we have to work hard to make ends meet, or unexpected expenses come up. It can make us sad or frustrated when we can't have everything we want.

时间

Sometimes it feels like there's not enough time in a day. We have many things to do, and fitting everything in is hard. We want to do well and succeed, so we try to do as much as possible. Thus, it's important to remember that time is precious, and we must use it wisely. We should make sure to prioritize the most important things and find a balance between work and play.

We can save a lot of valuable time and use the time to do other important stuff.

心情

doing xxx with family members after supper is a good way to relax after a hard day’s work. What’s more, it makes people feel less stressed and greatly influences how people think and talk. 

科技

All you need is wifi access and a laptop or tablet. And one doesn't have to move from one place to another. 

节日

Speaking of social celebration in my culture, there is one day of the year that is second to none, the Chinese New Year, which is also called the Spring Festival by most Chinese People. Even if you are indifferent to festive events, you cannot resist the charm of a family reunion dinner which marks the defining feature of the Spring Festival. And family members make toasts for each other to wish for joy, peace, health, and fortune for the next year.

电视

First, from the news broadcasted on television, we can know what is happening in the outside world even without stepping out of our living room with the television in it. I just want to keep myself informed of what’s happening worldwide. 

And second, watching television with family members after supper is a good way to relax after a hard day’s work. What’s more, its visual effect makes me feel less stressed and greatly influences how I think and talk. So that’s why I think it influences me the most.
