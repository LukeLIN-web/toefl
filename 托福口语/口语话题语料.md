那个老师也给了一个方法让我测试是否标准：可以对着打开苹果语音输入然后说口语，看哪些单词没被识别到，来自己找发音错误。课程和方法都感觉很有用。
推荐b站吴奇老师的tpo标准回答，可以学习语音语调观点和节奏。

20-24分 :  不要犹豫,


发音清晰, 无卡顿, 不要讲太快,口齿清楚. 

要提供足够的细节,  比如 it has the biggest, oldest department stores that you have ever seen.  可以举例子, 
不能只是 列出一堆理由然后不提供细节. 好看好玩好吃, 为啥好玩为啥好看? 


听力材料前面十秒会介绍背景, 不用记, 没有关系. 最关键的是和阅读材料的对比. 是怎么反驳的, 每个关键词要讲出来.

口语话题语料

其实可以用语音输入, 一下子就知道自己说的哪些太轻了, 哪些时态不对.

正面情绪:

a sense of achievement.



音乐:

It tells us a story about confidence and courage. I listen to this song whenever I am down, and it will immediately cheer me up. What’s more, I love this kind of music style. I prefer some songs with slow and emotional rhythms because when I am listening, I can think and appreciate the song's real meaning. Personally, I can’t bear those rock and roll songs. I think they are too noisy. Therefore I will recommend this song to everyone.

金钱

Sometimes we don't have enough money for what we want or need. Money helps us buy toys, clothes, and yummy food. It also helps our families pay for a cozy home and school supplies. But sometimes, there just isn't enough money to go around. Maybe our parents have to work really hard to make ends meet, or unexpected expenses come up. It can make us feel sad or frustrated when we can't have everything we want. But it's important to remember that money isn't everything. We can still find happiness and make the most of what we have by being grateful for the things we do have and finding joy in simple pleasures.

时间

Sometimes it feels like there's just not enough time in a day. We have so many things to do, and fitting everything in is hard. School, homework, and activities take up much of our time. Technology can be fun, but it can also make us lose track of time when we're playing games or watching videos. We want to do well and succeed, so we try to do as much as possible. But it's important to remember that time is precious, and we must use it wisely. We should make sure to prioritize the most important things and find a balance between work and play.
