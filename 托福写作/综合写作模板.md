The reading passage explores the issue of (名词, 名词短语或者how/what/whether/why引导的从句).
The professor's lecture deals with the same issue.

the professor argues in the lecture that (第一个反驳). This is because ()   ,which means (最好深入写一下, 如果没听出来, 那就转述一下)
Obviously, the professor's argument disproves its counterpart in the reading.//这个凑字数

Moreover, contrary to the statement in the reading that (第2个分论点,后面有支持的也可以转述一个), the professor contends that  (第2个反驳). 
Then he/she supports this point with the fact that (第2个支持论据)  In other words, (继续转述)

The professor proves that this claim is indefensible by pointing out that (第3个支持论据) That is to say(implying that xxxx),(继续转述,没时间或者转述不出来也没事) 
Thus, the reading material's statements are not logical.
